There is a great tutorial titled “How to Build a Python Bot That Can Play Web Games” that you can find at
http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/. This tutorial explains how
to create a GUI automation program in Python that plays a Flash game called Sushi Go
Round. The game involves clicking the correct ingredient buttons to fill customers’ sushi orders. The faster you
fill orders without mistakes, the more points you get. This is a perfectly suited task for a GUI automation program—and
a way to cheat to a high score! The tutorial covers many of the same topics that this chapter covers but also includes
descriptions of PyAutoGUI’s basic image recognition features."""
