Chapter 13 included a practice project to create custom invitations from a list of guests in a plaintext file.
As an additional project, use the pillow module to create images for custom seating cards for your guests. For each
of the guests listed in the guests.txt file from the resources at http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/, generate an
image file with the guest name and some flowery decoration. A public domain flower image is available in the
resources at http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/.

To ensure that each seating card is the same size, add a black rectangle on the edges of the invitation image so
that when the image is printed out, there will be a guideline for cutting. The PNG files that Pillow produces are
set to 72 pixels per inch, so a 4×5-inch card would require a 288×360-pixel image.
