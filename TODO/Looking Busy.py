Many instant messaging programs determine whether you are idle, or away from your computer, by detecting a lack
of mouse movement over some period of time—say, ten minutes. Maybe you’d like to sneak away from your desk for
a while but don’t want others to see your instant messenger status go into idle mode. Write a script to nudge your
mouse cursor slightly every ten seconds. The nudge should be small enough so that it won’t get in the way if you
do happen to need to use your computer while the script is running.
